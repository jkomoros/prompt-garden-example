# prompt-garden-example
An example of a web-app that uses prompt-garden as a node import

```
npm install

npm run serve
```

Then visit https://localhost:8082/

You can modify `seeds/index.json` to define a different seed, and each time you refresh the page it will run that seed.

If you use VSCode, when you're editing `seeds/index.json` it will automatically give you code completion and highlight errors. You can learn more about the seed format at https://github.com/jkomoros/prompt-garden and its README.
